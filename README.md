# Caesar_Cipher
Simple encoder and decoder for the encryption technique Caesar Cipher.

The cipher consists of replacing each letter in the message with another 'k' positions down/up in the alphabet. For example, choosing k = 3, the encoded phrase "Dungeons & Dragons" would be "Gxqjhrqv & Gudjrqv".

    NOTE: At the moment, it only works for the Windows os.
