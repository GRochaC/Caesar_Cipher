# Caesar_Cipher
Terminal based Caesar Cipher encoder and decoder.

This simple encryption technique consists of replacing each letter in the message with another 'k' positions down/up in the alphabet. For example, choosing k = 3, the encoded phrase "Dungeons & Dragons" would be "Gxqjhrqv & Gudjrqv".

NOTE: At the moment, it only works for the Windows os.
